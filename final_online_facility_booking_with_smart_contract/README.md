# Low-cost online booking solution using Smart Contract
We set out to determine whether, with recent blockchain innovations, it is possible to provide an affordable online facility booking solution to small to middle-sized residential management companies. The existing solution on the market seems to target large-sized condominium management companies. As facility booking is not the primary operation of residential management, it is hard to justify introducing a new system economically.  

Building an application utilizing blockchain technologies with widely available digital payment systems can help to reduce software development and operation costs. Therefore, there is a chance to offer an affordable facility booking system fitting those limited budget entities. I will explore the possibility. In this project, I provided a sample implementation of the online facility booking system. This could have never happened without `Sacffold-ETH`. Big thanks!
